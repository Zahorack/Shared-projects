# Introduction
I named the project GoldFish pair of devices with which i tried to acoustically invate carps in lakes to specific point and then easily catch them. Close to point where I put hook trap with eatable bait I also place my GoldFish device, which transmitted acoustic waves (vibrations) in water to surroundings. According to my hypothesis choosing right frequency should impress fishes.

# Scientific evidence

## Carps are hearing specialist

A human can generally hear between 20 and 20,000 Hertz, (Hertz is a measure of sound frequency, or pitch). The average cyprinid can hear between 5 and 2,000 Hertz so they can tune into lower, deeper sounds than us but not up to the higher frequencies.
Fish with hearing specializations such as swim bladders with an extensive use of sound pressure such as carps and catfishes

```
Fishes possess quite diverse hearing capacities. Hearing non-specialists (generalists) can detect low frequency sounds (<1 kHz) at relatively high sound intensities, whereas hearing specialists have evolved a variety of accessory hearing structures to enhance their ability to detect low intensity sounds in a broader frequency range.

### Science study I

```
This study investigated the response of common carp in an enclosed (man-made) water body
to two acoustic attractants (carp feeding and flowing water) and one repellent sound (high,
low/mid, and very low frequencies coupled with explosion sounds). 

Although the frequencies
and sound pressure levels were biologically relevant, the results indicate that feeding and
flowing water sounds have a limited effect and therefore do not appear suitable for
optimizing carp harvesting. Interestingly, the “assumed repellent” sound seemed to stimulate
exploration for the sound source which indicates that this sound or a component of it could
prove to be a useful attractant.

Interestingly, the “assumed repellent” sound seemed to act as an attractant. 
Even though tagged carp were aggregated near the speakers by broadcast feeding
prior to the repellent experiments there were distinct behavioural differences 
between feeding and experimental times. During feeding, carp displayed exploratory
movements while during the experimental period all tagged carp formed a tight 
aggregation directly at the speaker. This indicates that the repellent sound or 
a component of the sound (i.e. mid/high frequencies) may be a useful attractant
and this warrants further research.

## Carps also see well

```
“In the eye there are two types of photoreceptor cells clustered on the back portion of the eye (retina), these are cones and rods. ‘Cones’ detect colour while ‘rods’ detect differences in light intensity. The carp has four types of cone cell that detect red, green, blue and ultraviolet meaning carp can see a broader spectrum of light than humans. It has also been shown that near infrared light can be detected by carp. The fact that carp can detect a wider spectrum of light enables them to see in dark conditions such as at night or in turbid water. Moonlight is richer in longer wavelength light such as infrared which the carp may utilise when feeding in the dark. “As a general rule, while carp cannot focus on objects well they are very good at spotting fast movements both in and out of the water in clear conditions. So when stalking fish at close quarters, always move slowly, take cover behind bankside vegetation and try to wear clothes that blend in. If you do this you should go unnoticed and have a better chance of not putting the fish on edge and get them feeding confidently.”

### Science study II
```
Therefore, the absolute hearing threshold is less important than the ability of an
individual to detect a relevant signal against background noise.

demonstrated that cyprinids can fully utilize their excellent hearing sensitivity
in ‘quiet’ fresh water such as backwaters of rivers and lakes, but that
their hearing is highly masked in certain habitats such as running waters.

No significant reaction to the playback of feeding sounds was observed, although
some fish showed startle responses to feeding sounds or white noise or
both. One explanation for the lack of a consistent reaction of all fish may be
the lack of additional olfactory or visual cues, i.e. no sound-producing fish was
in sight. Phillips (1989) reported that rainbow trout reacted to feeding sounds
only when the test subjects had visual contact with their feeding conspecifics.
